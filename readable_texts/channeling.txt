Channeling is a conduit of celestial fury, an enchantment that empowers the trident to summon a devastating bolt of lightning from the storm-wracked heavens, striking down any foe or lightning rod it encounters during a thunderstorm. The wielder becomes a vessel for the storm's raw power, unleashing its wrath upon their enemies with each thrown weapon.
