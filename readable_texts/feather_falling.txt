Feather Falling is an arcane enchantment, a whispered pact with gravity itself. Imbued within the boots, it allows the wearer to fall like a feather, cushioning their descent. The very essence of lightness is woven into the footwear, granting a soft landing even from the greatest heights. It is not merely damage reduced, but the very force of gravity itself, subtly altered for the wearer's benefit.
