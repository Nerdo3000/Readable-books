Projectile Protection is an arcane inscription, a whispered blessing upon the armor, a pact with the forces of defense. It grants the wearer a shield against the onslaught of projectiles, reducing the damage received from arrows, fireballs, and other ranged attacks. The armor itself becomes a bulwark, a testament to the wearer's resilience.
