Breach is a devastating mace enchantment designed to pierce through defenses, systematically diminishing the effectiveness of an opponent's armor. As the enchantment level rises, the armor's protective qualities are increasingly compromised. This effect applies to all forms of armor worn by entities, as well as the inherent natural armor possessed by certain creatures.
