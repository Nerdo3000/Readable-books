Frost Walker is an arcane blessing, a pact with the winter's embrace, woven into the very essence of the boots. As the wearer treads upon water, the liquid yields to their presence, freezing into a crystalline path of frosted ice. The boots also grant immunity to the searing touch of fire, protecting against the flames of campfires and the molten wrath of magma.
