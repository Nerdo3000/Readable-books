Wind Burst, an enchantment for maces, unleashes the fury of the winds with each earth-shattering smash. Upon impact, a powerful upward knockback effect is unleashed, sending foes soaring skyward. Unlike the gentler touch of wind charges, this enchantment offers no solace against the perils of the fall. It is a force of raw power, a tempestuous surge that leaves its mark upon the battlefield.
