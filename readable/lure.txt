Lure is an arcane inscription, a whispered plea to the fish, etched into the rod's core. The rod becomes a conduit, a means to attract fish more quickly. Each cast is a prayer, a request for the fish to draw near. The enchantment grants the angler a heightened ability to shorten the wait, as if the very fish are eager to answer the call.
