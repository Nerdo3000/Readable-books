Infinity is an arcane blessing, a weaving of fate and chance into the very essence of the bow. It grants the wielder an endless supply of standard arrows, a never-ending stream of projectiles that flow forth from the quiver. The bow becomes a conduit of endless potential, a means to unleash a barrage of arrows without the worry of depletion.
