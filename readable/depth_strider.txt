Depth Strider is an enchantment of aquatic grace, a subtle weaving of arcane energies that reduces the resistance of water against the wearer's boots. The wearer glides through the depths, their movements fluid and unhindered. The very currents seem to yield to their passage, as if guided by an unseen hand.
