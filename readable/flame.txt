This enchantment imbues each arrow with the essence of ember, a burning spark of elemental fire. Upon release, the arrow is kissed by flame, transforming into a fiery projectile that ignites upon impact. The bow becomes a conduit of burning energy, each shot a miniature inferno. The target is not merely struck, but consumed, engulfed in a blaze that mirrors the burning intensity of the enchantment itself.
