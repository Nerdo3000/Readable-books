Looting is an arcane blessing, a weaving of fate and chance into the very blade. It grants the wielder a heightened ability to pluck forth the bounty of the slain, increasing the likelihood of receiving more treasures from fallen foes. The sword becomes a conduit of prosperity, a means to coax forth hidden riches and amplify the yield of each strike.
